# Data Preparation

The code provided is compatible with [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/lidar-segmentation) and [semantic KITTI](http://www.semantic-kitti.org/tasks.html#semseg). 
Put the datasets you intend to use in the datasets folder.


## nuScenes

To install the [nuScenes-lidarseg](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) dataset, download the data, annotations, and other files from https://www.nuscenes.org/download.

Unpack the compressed file(s) into `/data/sets/nuscenes` and your folder structure should end up looking like this:

```
└── nuscenes  
    ├── Usual nuscenes folders (i.e. samples, sweep)
    │
    ├── lidarseg
    │   └── v1.0-{mini, test, trainval} <- contains the .bin files; a .bin file 
    │                                      contains the labels of the points in a 
    │                                      point cloud (note that v1.0-test does not 
    │                                      have any .bin files associated with it)
    │
    └── v1.0-{mini, test, trainval}
        ├── Usual files (e.g. attribute.json, calibrated_sensor.json etc.)
        ├── lidarseg.json  <- contains the mapping of each .bin file to the token   
        └── category.json  <- contains the categories of the labels (note that the 
                              category.json from nuScenes v1.0 is overwritten)
```

## SemanticKITTI

To install the [SemanticKITTI](http://semantic-kitti.org/index) dataset, download the data, annotations, and other files from http://semantic-kitti.org/dataset.

Unpack the compressed file(s) into `/data/sets/semantickitti` and re-organize the data structure. Your folder structure should end up looking like this:

```
└── semantickitti  
    └── sequences
        ├── velodyne <- contains the .bin files; a .bin file contains the points in a point cloud
        │    └── 00
        │    └── ···
        │    └── 21
        ├── labels   <- contains the .label files; a .label file contains the labels of the points in a point cloud
        │    └── 00
        │    └── ···
        │    └── 10
        ├── calib
        │    └── 00
        │    └── ···
        │    └── 21
        └── semantic-kitti.yaml
```
