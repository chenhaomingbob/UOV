## nuScenes

To install the [nuScenes-lidarseg](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) dataset, download the data, annotations, and other files from https://www.nuscenes.org/download.

Unpack the compressed file(s) into `/data/sets/nuscenes` and your folder structure should end up looking like this:

```
└── nuscenes  
    ├── Usual nuscenes folders (i.e. samples, sweep)
    │
    ├── lidarseg
    │   └── v1.0-{mini, test, trainval} <- contains the .bin files; a .bin file 
    │                                      contains the labels of the points in a 
    │                                      point cloud (note that v1.0-test does not 
    │                                      have any .bin files associated with it)
    │
    └── v1.0-{mini, test, trainval}
        ├── Usual files (e.g. attribute.json, calibrated_sensor.json etc.)
        ├── lidarseg.json  <- contains the mapping of each .bin file to the token   
        └── category.json  <- contains the categories of the labels (note that the 
                              category.json from nuScenes v1.0 is overwritten)
```

Please note that you should cite the corresponding paper(s) once you use the dataset.

```


## SemanticKITTI

To install the [SemanticKITTI](http://semantic-kitti.org/index) dataset, download the data, annotations, and other files from http://semantic-kitti.org/dataset.

Unpack the compressed file(s) into `/data/sets/semantickitti` and re-organize the data structure. Your folder structure should end up looking like this:

```
└── semantickitti  
    └── sequences
        ├── velodyne <- contains the .bin files; a .bin file contains the points in a point cloud
        │    └── 00
        │    └── ···
        │    └── 21
        ├── labels   <- contains the .label files; a .label file contains the labels of the points in a point cloud
        │    └── 00
        │    └── ···
        │    └── 10
        ├── calib
        │    └── 00
        │    └── ···
        │    └── 21
        └── semantic-kitti.yaml
```

```


## ScribbleKITTI

To install the [ScribbleKITTI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08537) dataset, download the annotations from https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/ouenal/scribblekitti.zip. Note that you only need to download these annotation files (~118.2MB); the data is the same as [SemanticKITTI](http://semantic-kitti.org/index).

Unpack the compressed file(s) into `/data/sets/scribblekitti` and re-organize the data structure. Your folder structure should end up looking like this:


```
└── scribblekitti 
    └── sequences
        └── scribbles <- contains the .label files; a .label file contains the scribble labels of the points in a point cloud
             └── 00
             └── ···
             └── 10
